# Plan

- Create a mock website / store front. 

- Use the Fake API shop to get data

- Have a component for the main "grid" where the tiles sit. 
- Put this information into tiles. 
    - map over the data and each tile will be it's own component. 

    - Tile includes information from the API for the product. 
        -picture 
        - title
        - price 
        - category 
        - description
        - image

    Button to add to basket, seperate component. 
    - This will have the logic to add the item to the basket. 
    - We will need to check if the item is already in the basket. 


- Put the tiles into a responsive grid / flex box 

- Another component - the shopping cart, this will be a drawer that pops out. 


THINGS TO THINK ABOUT

- Is the item already in the basket?
